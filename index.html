    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="hellotext">I am a college student at Metro Community College. After Metro, I will be transferring to University of Nebraska-Omaha to 
        get my B.S. in computer science and mathamatics. After I snatch that diploma I will become a software engineer, hopefully in Cali.</p>
    <p class="hellotext">In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to music, running, and learning new things.</p>
    <p class="hellotext">This website will continue to evolve as I learn how to make a better site. I'm considering adding features like a blog or a book/document library.
      If you have any ideas for what I could add, let me know. Also, the site doesn't look the best on mobile because I haven't gotten that far in my web dev findings yet. </p>

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>I've been a section leader 3 times in my marching seasons. I've also been the VP of Finance for a student ran company in Lincoln. I've learned 
        way more from my failures then my successes. The successes were quite enjoyable though, notably with Railmen Indoor Percussion. I'm always reading or watching content
        to be a better leader others and myself. If you can't lead yourself first, then you can't lead others. Leading by example, being open minded, effective communication, 
        and constantly learning are a few things I've learned that make great and effective leaders.</p>
